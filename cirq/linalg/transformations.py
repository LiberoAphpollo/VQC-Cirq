    Note that the matrix must have a compatible tensor structure.

    For example, if you have an 6-qubit state vector `input_state` with shape
    (2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2), and a 2-qubit unitary operation `op` with shape
    (2, 2, 2, 2), and you want to apply `op` to the 5'th and 3'rd qubits
    within `input_state`, then the output state vector is computed as follows:

        output_state = cirq.targeted_left_multiply(op, input_state, [5, 3])

    This method also works when the right hand side is a matrix instead of a
    vector. If a unitary circuit's matrix is `old_effect`, and you append
    a CNOT(q1, q4) operation onto the circuit, where the control q1 is the qubit
    at offset 1 and the target q4 is the qubit at offset 4, then the appended
    circuit's unitary matrix is computed as follows:

            left_matrix=cirq.unitary(cirq.CNOT).reshape((2, 2, 2, 2)),
            right_target=old_effect,

    Args:
        left_matrix: What to left-multiply the target tensor by.
        right_target: A tensor to carefully broadcast a left-multiply over.
        target_axes: Which axes of the target are being operated on.
        out: The buffer to store the results in. If not specified or None, a new
            buffer is used. Must have the same shape as right_target.
